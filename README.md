# Predicting Diabetes Using Perceptron

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a perceptron algorithm to predict the presence of diabetes. The dataset used is sourced from a medical dataset and is preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the perceptron model.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Implementation of the perceptron algorithm
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results and insights

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hariharan-Durairaj/Predicting-diabetes-using-perceptron.git
   cd Predicting-diabetes-using-perceptron
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Predicting_diabetes_using_perceptron.ipynb
   ```

2. Execute the cells step by step to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Train the perceptron model
   - Evaluate and visualize the modelâ€™s performance

## Dependencies

The `requirements.txt` file includes the following:

```
numpy==1.25.2
pandas==1.5.3
matplotlib==3.4.3
seaborn==0.13.2
scikit-learn==1.3.0
pytorch==2.0.1
torchvision==0.15.2
jupyter
```

## Results

The notebook evaluates the perceptron model's accuracy and visualizes the key metrics, such as the confusion matrix and classification report.
